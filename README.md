# SVG Logo Maker
[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org)

## Description
This project is aimed at creating logos for projects to add personality to projects without needing to create it in photo-shop or going through a graphic artist. By answering 4 simple questions, users can create a square, circle or triangle with up to 3 characters placed inside of the letter. Some challenges faced in this project was working with Jest.io. The issue was trying to write tests for code that wasn't written yet. This was a challenge because the test being written requires knowledge of what the final code/output should be. Another challenge was figuring out how to make sure that the colors the user chooses will be web safe for most browsers. 

Example of shapes to be made with the program (code for these can be viewed in the examples/demo folder):

Circle:

Triangle:

Square:
